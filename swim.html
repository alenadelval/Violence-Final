  <div class="text"> A scene in Narcosis has the player take oxygen from another suite while the player can hear cries for help. However, the player does not know if it was just an auditory hallucination or if the cries came from an person in the game that survived the initial accident. The game is based on limited knowledge and choices on survival. Narcosis is able to disorient the player and force them to make difficult choices that people would not have to do in their ordinary life.</div>
