    <div class="text">Detroit: Become Human confronts contriversial topics of judgements based on prexisting ideas. In the game, the player can immediately get their character killed off and lose. It shows that sometimes the world is not fair and that is how it currently exists. There is violence around every corner even if an individual seems to have done nothing wrong. While in Addicted to the Violence the police officer only arrests you, police brutality is portrayed in Detroit: Become Human. A scene involves a police officer taking out his gun on peaceful protesting androids due to fear even though the androids were behaving peacefully. Violence can be triggered through peaceful situations due to misjudgement. Detroit: Become Human does not portray any actions as good or bad but rather as here is what is happening, what will you do? The game takes ethical questions that, while provide entertainment for the player, requires them to think about their actions and the consequences it could have.</div>
