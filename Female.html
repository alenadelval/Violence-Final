    <div class="text"> This character image was taken from a game called Mortal Kombat X. A significant portion of video games portray all women as beautiful, skinny with an hourglass figure. Furthermore, video games portray women as 'weaker' characters. Females typically have less health and do less damage than their male counterpart. However, to compensate for their lack of damage, specificaly in fighting games such as Mortal Kombat, female characters have faster movement speed. Almost all of the street fighting oversexualize their female characters and follow the stereotype. This reflects society as a whole by constantly oversexualizing women and portraying them as the weaker sex. In Mortal Kombat 4, Tanya had a fatality, Kiss of Deceit, that involved in her kissing the cheek of the enemy opponent causing the enemy to twist and then explode. Similarily, another character called Kitana had a fatality called Kiss of Death. Mortal Kombat sexualizes these female characters and involves in taunts about sex and betrayal as well as 'kissing' finishing moves to kill the opponent. Men do not have similar fatalities in Mortal Kombat. </div>
