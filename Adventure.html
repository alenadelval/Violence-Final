    <div class="text">This image is from a game called Detroit: Become Human. This game explores a world where androids are becoming sentient beings while they are still viewed as less than people; just a machine. As player goes about the game, they can choose their actions such as peaceful or aggressive. Each action results in a consequence or a benefit to the character. This is the basis to how this catalogue is layed out. Each choice results in a different outcome. Detroit uses violence for entertainment as well as showing the reader that these reflect current day problems as well as potential issues. Detroit addresses discrimination and violence towards race as well as ethics. The game takes place in a time where andriods function almost identically as humans and have started to develope emotions. While some humans support equal rights for androids, others do not and the game allows the player to choose their own actions as well as facing consequences. This reflects racism in the modern age where while most people support equality between all races, others remain racist and preform hate crimes. Furthermore, as technology continues to develope, it brings up new questions that Detroit: Become Human allows you to address: if androids become sentient, what would society do?</div>
