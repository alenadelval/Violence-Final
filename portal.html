  <h1 class="animated fadeInDown">Addicted to the Violence</h1>
  <h2 class="animated fadeInDown"> Regardless of your choices, they all ended in violently. The game's focus is to understand that for all of the games used as well as this game that was created, violence is a core feature. Detroit: Become Human uses violences towards race and ethics, Narcosis uses violence towards the mind, Outlast and Portal both use outright violent actions as well as violence towards the mind each in their own way, and finally, Mortal Kombat uses violence towards women. These are only a few of many videogames that uses violence to entertain the player. Many Triple-A games use violence to entice the user with flashy gameplay. While violence in videogames provides entertainment, it creates controversy. Detroit: Become Human faced lash back due to it's use of child abuse for entertainment. While the player can choose to save and aid the child, there is the option to do nothing. At what point should there be a line drawn in video games? </h2>

<div class="text">"The cake is a lie" is a reference to a game called Portal. Throughout Portal, the player is required to solve puzzles and is promised a cake in the end for their trouble. However, it becomes slowly more evident that the robot voice that is telling you to complete these tasks is actually attempting to murder the player. There is no cake in the game, just death hence the joke 'the cake is a lie'. Portal starts off as a simple puzzle game where the player has to figure out how to escape each room by creating portals. As levels progress, they get harder and start to include ways the player can die. At the end, the player must fight the machine in order to survive. Portal starts off as a simple puzzle game but then becomes a violent survival based game. The game deceives you into thinking it is just a normal problem solving game without much of a story. As the game goes on, more and more is revealed and the machines words and actions get increasingly hostile.</div>
