  <div class="text">This image is from a game called Narcosis. Narcosis utulizes virtual reality horror in order for a fully immersive experience. Your character is trapped underwater with limited oxygen in a claustrophobic setting. Slowly, your character starts to lose touch with reality and begins to hallucinate. However, some of the threats are real yet you will not know which.
  It is a slow decent into insanity causing the player question reality itself. This is violence towards the mind, tricking and confusing the player with fear. Narcosis uses limited knowledge of whats going on and claustrophobia in VR to effectively scare the user. While some users refuse to play horror games, especially VR ones, others are addicted to the adrenaline and fear that these provide.</div>
